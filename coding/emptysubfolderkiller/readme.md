empty subfolder killer

Count or delete all empty subfolders. Tested on  
win7 x64 python3.4  
ubuntu linux 32bit 16.04 python 3.5.2  

Linux had some problems with mounting external partitions,  
after script complete deleting process, but after reboot  
system all work done (be careful)

script have options  
0 - count empty subfolders  
1 - delete empty subfolders
